Read this file if you are a Debian Developer or would like to become
one, or if you would like to create your own binary packages of GCC.

* Overview

From the GCC sources, Debian currently builds 4 source packages and
almost 100 binary packages, using a single set of build scripts.  The
4 source packages are:

gcc-4.2: C, C++, Fortran, Objective-C and Objective-C++, plus many
         common libraries like libssp, libmudflap and libgcc.
gcj-4.2: Java.
gnat-4.2: Ada.
gdc-4.2: D.

The way we do this is quite peculiar, so listen up :)

When we build from the gcc-4.2 source package, we produce, among many
others, a gcc-4.2-source binary package that contains the pristine
upstream tarball and some Debian-specific patches.  Any user can then
install this package on their Debian system, and will have the full
sources in /usr/src/gcc-4.2/gcc-<version>.tar.bz2, along with the
Makefile snippets that unpack and patch them.

The intended use for this package is twofold: (a) allow users to build
their own cross-compilers, and (b) build the other packages: gcj-4.2,
gnat-4.2 and gdc-4.2, which build-depend on gcc-4.2-source.

For these other packages, the "source tarball" just contains an empty
directory; e.g.:

$ tar tzf gnat-4.2_4.2-20070609.orig.tar.gz
gnat-4.2-4.2-20070609.orig/

The build scripts for all source packages are the same, and they are
included, as usual, in the .diff.gz file.

* The build sequence

As for all other Debian packages, you build GCC by calling
debian/rules.

The first thing debian/rules does it to look at the top-most entry in
debian/changelog: this tells it which source package it is building.
For example, if the first entry in debian/changelog reads:

gcj-4.2 (4.2-20070609-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload as gcj-4.2.

then, debian/rules will build only the Java binary packages.

The second step is to unpack the GCC source tarball.  This tarball is
either in the build directory (when building gcc-4.2), or in
/usr/src/gcc-4.2/gcc-<timestamp>.tar.bz2 (when building the other
source packages).

The third step is to build debian/control from debian/control.m4 and a
complex set of rules specified in debian/rules.conf.  The resulting
control file contains only the binary packages to be built.

The fourth step is to select which patches to apply (this is done in
debian/rules.defs), and then to apply the selected patches (see
debian/rules.patch).

The fifth step is to create a "build" directory, cd into it, call
../src/configure, and bootstrap the compiler and libraries selected.
This is in debian/rules2.

The sixth step is to call "make install" in the build directory: this
installs the compiler and libraries into debian/tmp
(i.e. debian/tmp/usr/bin/gcc, etc.)

The seventh step is to run the GCC test suite (this actually takes at
least as much time as bootstrapping, and you can disable it by setting
WITHOUT_CHECK to "yes" in the environment).

The eighth step is to build the binary packages, i.e. the .debs.  This
is done by a set of language- and architecture-dependent Makefile
snippets in the debian/rules.d/ directory, which move files from the
debian/tmp tree to the debian/<package> trees.

* Making your own packages

In this example, we will build our own gnat-4.2 package.

1) Create a .orig.tar.gz tarball containing a single, empty directory.

$ mkdir gnat-4.2-4.2-20070609.orig
$ tar czf gnat-4.2_4.2-20070609.orig.tar.gz gnat-4.2-4.2-20070609.orig

2) Install gcc-4.2-source, which contains the real sources:

# apt-get install gcc-4.2-source

3) Create a build directory:

$ mkdir gnat-4.2-4.2-20070609; cd gnat-4.2-4.2-20070609

4) Checkout from Subversion:

$ svn checkout svn://svn.debian.org/gcccvs/branches/sid/gcc-4.2/debian

5) Edit the debian/changelog file, adding a new entry at the top that
   starts with "gnat-4.2" instead of "gcc-4.2".

6) Generate the debian/control file, adjusted for gnat:

$ debian/rules control

7) Build:

$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

* Hints

You need a powerful machine to build GCC.  The larger, the better.
The build scripts take advantage of as many CPU cores as are available
in your box.  If you have 2 GB or more of physical RAM, you can
achieve maximum performance by building in a tmpfs, like this:

1) as root, create the new tmpfs:

# mount -t tmpfs -o size=1280m none /home/lbrenta/src/debian/ram

By default, the tmpfs will be limited to half your physical RAM.  The
beauty of it is that it only consumes as much physical RAM as
necessary to hold the files in it; deleting files frees up RAM.

2) As your regular user, create the working directory in the tmpfs

$ cp --archive ~/src/debian/gcc-4.2-4.2-20070609 ~/src/debian/ram

3) Build in there.  On my dual-core, 2 GHz amd64, it takes 34 minutes
   to build gnat, and the tmpfs takes 992 MB of physical RAM but
   exceeds 1 Gb during the build.

Note that the build process uses a lot of temporary files.  Your $TEMP
directory should therefore also be in a ram disk.  You can achieve
that either by mounting it as tmpfs, or by setting TEMP to point to
~/src/debian/ram.

* Patching GCC

Debian applies a large number of patches to GCC as part of the build
process.  The patches are shell scripts located in debian/patches.
The file debian/rules.defs selects which patches to apply, and in
which order.  Then, debian/rules.patch applies them in order and
produces a file listing the applied patches in order in
stamps/02-patch-stamp.

There is currently no tool to help modify patches; you have to do it
by hand.  Here is one possible way to do it:

1) Apply all patches up to and EXCLUDING the patch you intend to
   modify, in order.

2) Make a deep copy of the src directory, e.g.
   $ cp --archive src src.bak

3) Apply the patch you intend to modify.

4) Open the .dpatch file in your editor and remove the entire patch
   section; leave alone the shell script part at the top.

5) Change the files you want in the src directory.  After making
   changes, you can experiment with
   $ make -C build -jK
   (where K is the number of processor threads you have)

6) $ diff -rNu src.bak src >> debian/patches/<file>.dpatch

7) Apply all remaining patches, to see if your change broke any of
   them.

8) $ svn commit debian/patches/<file>.dpatch

If you want to add a new patch, the procedure is similar.  You must
first choose where in the list of patches you want to insert your new
patch.  Then, apply all patches up to that point and start editing.

** Patching GCC with Quilt

The above method uses an entire copy of the source tree, which is
currently 421 megabytes in size.  If you are in a one-gigabyte ram
disk (see Hints above), this may be a problem.  One solution to this
problem is to use quilt, which will only keep copies of the files
touched by patches, not all files.  It also automates the updating of
a patch after you change the sources.

Quilt however does not take into account the selection of patches made
in debian/rules.defs; instead it has a static list of patches.  After
calling "debian/rules patch", you can generate such a list like this:

$ egrep '^[^ ]+:' stamps/02-patch-stamp | \
  sed 's!:!.dpatch -p0!' > debian/patches/series

Unfortunately, not all patches are applied with -p0; you must then
edit debian/patches/series by hand to replace -p0 with -p1 for a few
patches.

Once you have your debian/patches/series:

$ debian/rules unpatch
$ export QUILT_PATCHES=$PWD/debian/patches
$ cd src
$ quilt push -a (or quild push <patch_name>)
edit files at will; quilt add <file_name> to add a new file to the patch
$ make -C ../build
$ quilt refresh
$ quilt push -a #Â check that no patch is broken
$ quilt pop -a
$ cd ..
$ debian/rules clean build
$ svn commit
