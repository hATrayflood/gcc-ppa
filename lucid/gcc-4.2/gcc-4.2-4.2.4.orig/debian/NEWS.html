GCC 4.2 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes
</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>GCC no longer accepts the <code>-fshared-data</code> option.
      This option has had no effect in any GCC 4 release; the targets
      to which the option used to apply had been removed before GCC 4.0.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p>New command-line options specify the possible relationships among
    parameters and between parameters and global data.  For example,
    <code>-fargument-noalias-anything</code> specifies that arguments
    do not alias any other storage.</p>

    <p>Each language will automatically use whatever option is required
    by the language standard.  You should not need to use these options
    yourself.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../projects/gomp/">OpenMP</a> is now
        supported for the C, C++ and Fortran compilers.</li>

    <li>New command line options <code>-fstrict-overflow</code> and
    <code>-Wstrict-overflow</code> have been added.
    <code>-fstrict-overflow</code> tells the compiler that it may
    assume that the program follows the strict signed overflow
    semantics permitted for the language: for C and C++ this means
    that the compiler may assume that signed overflow does not occur.
    For example, a loop like
    <pre>
      for (i = 1; i > 0; i *= 2)
    </pre>
    is presumably intended to continue looping until <code>i</code>
    overflows.  With <code>-fstrict-overflow</code>, the compiler may
    assume that signed overflow will not occur, and transform this
    into an infinite loop.  <code>-fstrict-overflow</code> is turned
    on by default at <code>-O2</code>, and may be disabled via
    <code>-fno-strict-overflow</code>.  The
    <code>-Wstrict-overflow</code> option may be used to warn about
    cases where the compiler assumes that signed overflow will not
    occur.  It takes five different levels:
    <code>-Wstrict-overflow=1</code> to <code>5</code>.  See the
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html">
    documentation</a> for details.  <code>-Wstrict-overflow=1</code>
    is enabled by <code>-Wall</code>.</li>

    <li>The new command line option <code>-fno-toplevel-reorder</code>
    directs GCC to emit top-level functions, variables, and
    <code>asm</code> statements in the same order that they appear in
    the input file.  This is intended to support existing code which
    relies on a particular ordering (for example, code which uses
    top-level <code>asm</code> statements to switch sections).  For
    new code, it is generally better to use function and variable
    attributes.  The <code>-fno-toplevel-reorder</code> option may be
    used for most cases which currently use
    <code>-fno-unit-at-a-time</code>.  The
    <code>-fno-unit-at-a-time</code> option will be removed in some
    future version of GCC.  If you know of a case which requires
    <code>-fno-unit-at-a-time</code> which is not fixed by
    <code>-fno-toplevel-reorder</code>, please <a
    href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs.html">open a bug report</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>C family</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The pragma <code>redefine_extname</code> will now 
        macro expand its tokens for compatibility with 
        SunPRO.</li>

    <li>In the next release of GCC, 4.3, <code>-std=c99</code> or
        <code>-std=gnu99</code> will direct GCC to handle inline
        functions as specified in the C99 standard.  In preparation
        for this, GCC 4.2 will warn about any use of non-static inline
        functions in gnu99 or c99 mode.  This new warning may be
        disabled with the new <code>gnu_inline</code> function
        attribute or the new <code>-fgnu89-inline</code> command line
        option.  Also, GCC 4.2 and later will define one of the
        preprocessor macros <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> or
        <code>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</code> to indicate the semantics of
        inline functions in the current compilation.</li>

    <li>A new command line option <code>-Waddress</code> has been
        added to warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses as,
        for example, using the address of a function in a conditional
        expression, and comparisons against the memory address of a
        string literal.  This warning is enabled by
        <code>-Wall</code>.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>C++ visibility handling has been overhauled.</p>

      <p>Restricted visiblity is propagated from classes to members, from
      functions to local statics, and from templates and template arguments
      to instantiations, unless the latter has explicitly declared visibility.
      </p>

      <p>The visibility attribute for a class must come between the class-key
      and the name, not after the closing brace.</p>

      <p>Attributes are now allowed for enums and elaborated-type-specifiers
      that only declare a type.</p>

      <p>Members of the anonymous namespace are now local to a particular
      translation unit, along with any other declarations which use them,
      though they are still treated as having external linkage for language
      semantics.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     The (undocumented) extension which permitted templates with
     default arguments to be bound to template template parameters with
     fewer parameters has been removed.  For example:

      <pre>
	template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class C&gt;
	void f(C&lt;double&gt;) {}

	template &lt;typename T, typename U = int&gt;
	struct S {};

	template void f(S&lt;double&gt;);
      </pre>      

     is no longer accepted by G++.  The reason this code is not
     accepted is that <code>S</code> is a template with two parameters;
     therefore, it cannot be bound to <code>C</code> which has only
     one parameter.
    </li>

    <li>
     The <code>&lt;?</code>, <code>&gt;?</code>, <code>&lt;?=</code>,
     and <code>&gt;?=</code> operators,
     deprecated in previous GCC releases, have been removed.
    </li>

    <li>
     The command line option <code>-fconst-strings</code>, deprecated in
     previous GCC releases, has been removed.
    </li>

    <li>
     The configure variable <code>enable-__cxa_atexit</code> is now enabled by
     default for more targets.  Enabling this variable is necessary in order for
     static destructors to be executed in the correct order, but it depends upon
     the presence of a non-standard C library in the target library in order to
     work.  The variable is now enabled for more targets which are known to have
     suitable C libraries.
     </li>
     <li>
     <code>-Wextra</code> will produce warnings for <code>if</code> statements
     with a semicolon as the only body, to catch code like:

     <pre>
         if (a);
            return 1;
         return 0;
     </pre>

     To suppress the warning in valid cases, use <code>{ }</code> instead.
    </li>
    <li>
     The C++ frontend now also produces strict aliasing warnings when
     <code>-fstrict-aliasing -Wstrict-aliasing</code> is in effect.
    </li>
  </ul> 

  <h4>Runtime Library (libstdc++)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for TR1 &lt;random&gt;, &lt;complex&gt;, and C
    compatibility headers. In addition, a lock-free version of
    <code>shared_ptr</code> was contributed as part of Phillip
    Jordan's Google Summer of Code project on lock-free
    containers. The implementation status for TR1 can be tracked in <a
    href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/ext/tr1.html">tr1.html</a> 
   </li>
   <li>In association with the Summer of Code work on lock-free
   containers, the interface for atomic builtins was adjusted,
   creating simpler alternatives for non-threaded code paths. Also,
   usage was consolidated and all elements were moved from
   <code>namespace std</code> to
   <code>namespace__gnu_cxx</code>. Affected interfaces are the
   functions <code>__exchange_and_add</code>,
   <code>__atomic_add</code>, and the objects <code>__mutex</code>,
   <code>__recursive_mutex</code>, and
   <code>__scoped_lock</code>. </li>
   <li>Support for versioning weak symbol names via namespace
   association was added. However, as this changes the names of
   exported symbols, this is turned off by default in the current
   ABI. Intrepid users can enable this feature by using 
   <code>--enable-symvers=gnu-versioned-namespace</code> during configuration.
   </li>
   <li>Revised, simplified, and expanded policy-based associative
   containers, including data types for tree and trie forms
   (<code>basic_tree</code>, <code>tree</code>, <code>trie</code>),
   lists (<code>list_update</code>), and both collision-chaining and
   probing hash-based containers (<code>basic_hash_table</code>,
   <code>cc_hash_table</code>, <code>gp_hash_table</code>). More details
   per the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/ext/pb_ds/index.html">documentation.</a>
   </li>
   <li>The implementation of the debug mode was modified, whereby the
   debug namespaces were nested inside of <code>namespace std</code>
   and <code>namespace __gnu_cxx</code> in order to resolve some long
   standing corner cases involving name lookup. Debug
   functionality from the policy-based data structures was
   consolidated and enabled with the single macro,
   <code>_GLIBCXX_DEBUG</code>. See PR 26142 for more
   information.</li>
   <li> Added extensions for type traits:
   <code>__conditional_type</code>, <code>__numeric_traits</code>,
   <code>__add_unsigned</code>, <code>__removed_unsigned</code>,
   <code>__enable_if</code>. </li>
   <li> Added a typelist implementation for compile-time
   meta-programming. Elements for typelist construction and operation can be 
   found within <code>namespace __gnu_cxx::typelist</code>.</li>
   <li> Added a new allocator, <code>__gnu_cxx::throw_allocator</code>, for
testing exception-safety.</li>
   <li> Enabled library-wide visibility control, allowing
   <code>-fvisibility</code> to be used.</li>
   <li> Consolidated all nested namespaces and the
   conversion of <code>__gnu_internal</code> implementation-private
   details to anonymous namespaces whenever possible.</li>
   <li>Implemented LWG resolutions DR 431 and DR 538.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Fortran</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for allocatable components has been added (TR 15581 and
        Fortran 2003).</li>
    <li>Support for the Fortran 2003 streaming IO extension has been
        added.</li>
    <li>The GNU Fortran compiler now uses 4-byte record markers by default
    for unformatted files to be compatible with g77 and most other compilers.
    The implementation allows for records greater than 2 GB and  is compatible
    with several other compilers. Older versions of gfortran used 8-byte
    record markers by default (on most systems). In order to change the length
    of the record markers, e.g. to read unformatted files created by older
    gfortran versions, the <code>
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Runtime-Options.html"
    >-frecord-marker=8</a></code> option can be used.</li>
  </ul>


<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
     A new command line option <code>-static-libgcj</code> has been
     added for targets that use a linker compatible with GNU Binutils.
     As its name implies, this causes libgcj to be linked statically.
     In some cases this causes the resulting executable to start
     faster and use less memory than if the shared version of libgcj
     were used.  However caution should be used as it can also cause
     essential parts of the library to be omitted.  Some of these issues are
     discussed in:
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Statically%20linking%20libgcj">
	   http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Statically%20linking%20libgcj
      </a>
    </li>

    <li><code>fastjar</code> is no longer bundled with GCC.  To build
        libgcj, you will need either InfoZIP (both <code>zip</code>
        and <code>unzip</code>) or an external <code>jar</code> program.
        In the former case, the GCC build will install a <code>jar</code>
        shell script that is based on InfoZIP and provides the same
	functionality as <code>fastjar</code>.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>IA-32/x86-64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><code>-mtune=generic</code> can now be used to generate code running
        well on common x86 chips. This includes AMD Athlon,
	AMD Opteron, Intel Pentium-M, Intel Pentium 4 and Intel Core 2.</li>
    <li><code>-mtune=native</code> and <code>-march=native</code> will produce
        code optimized for the host architecture as detected using the
	<code>cpuid</code> instruction.</li>
    <li>Added a new command line option <code>-fstackrealign</code> and
        and <code>__attribute__ ((force_align_arg_pointer))</code>
        to realign the stack at runtime.  This allows functions compiled
        with a vector-aligned stack to be invoked from legacy objects
        that keep only word-alignment.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>SPARC</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The default CPU setting has been changed from V7 to V9 in 32-bit
	mode on Solaris 7 and above.  This is already the case in 64-bit
	mode.  It can be overridden by specifying <code>--with-cpu</code>
	at configure time.</li>
    <li>Back-end support of built-in functions for atomic memory access
	has been implemented.</li>
    <li>Support for the Sun UltraSPARC T1 (Niagara) processor has been
	added.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>M32C</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Various bug fixes have made some functions (notably, functions
        returning structures) incompatible with previous releases.
        Recompiling all libraries is recommended.  Note that code
        quality has considerably improved since 4.1, making a
        recompile even more beneficial.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>MIPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the Broadcom SB-1A core.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>IA-64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for IA-64 data and control speculation.  By default
        speculation is enabled only during second scheduler pass.  A number of
        machine flags was introduced to control the usage of speculation for both
        scheduler passes.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>HPPA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Added Java language support (libffi and libjava) for 32-bit
         HP-UX 11 target.</li>
  </ul>


<h2><a name="obsolete_systems">Obsolete Systems</a></h2>

<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>

<h3>PDF Documentation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>A <code>make pdf</code> target has been added to the 
        top-level makefile, enabling automated production of PDF
        documentation files.  (Front-ends external to GCC should modify
        their <code>Make-lang.in</code> file to add a <code>lang.pdf:</code>
        target.)</p></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>

<h3>Build system improvements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>All the components of the compiler are now bootstrapped by
        default.  This improves the resilience to bugs in the system
        compiler or binary compatibility problems, as well as providing
        better testing of GCC 4.2 itself.  In addition, if you build
	the compiler from a combined tree, the assembler, linker, etc.
	will also be bootstrapped (i.e. built with themselves).</p>

        <p>You can disable this behavior, and go back to
	the pre-GCC 4.2 set up, by configuring GCC with
	<code>--disable-bootstrap</code>.</p></li>

    <li><p>The rules that <code>configure</code> follows to find target tools
        resemble more closely the locations that the built compiler
        will search.  In addition, you can use the new configure option
        <code>--with-target-tools</code> to specify where to find the
        target tools used during the build, without affecting what the
        built compiler will use.</p>

        <p>This can be especially useful when building packages of
        GCC.  For example, you may want to build GCC with
        GNU <code>as</code> or <code>ld</code>, even if the resulting compiler
        to work with the native assembler and linker.  To do so, you
        can use <code>--with-target-tools</code> to point to the native
        tools.</p></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Incompatible changes to the build system</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Front-ends external to GCC should modify their
	<code>Make-lang.in</code> file to replace double-colon rules (e.g.
	<code>dvi::</code>) with normal rules (like <code>lang.dvi:</code>).
	Front-end makefile hooks do not use double-colon rules anymore.</li>

    <li>Up to GCC 4.1, a popular way to specify the target tools used
        during the build was to create directories named <code>gas</code>,
	<code>binutils</code>, etc. in the build tree, and create
	links to the tools from there.	This does not work any more
	when the compiler is bootstrapped.  The new configure option
	<code>--with-target-tools</code> provides a better way to achieve
	the same effect, and works for all native and cross settings.</li>
  </ul>
