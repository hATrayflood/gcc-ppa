* General

- Clean up the sprawl of debian/rules.  I'm sure there are neater
  ways to do some of it; perhaps split it up into some more files?
  Partly done.

- Make debian/rules control build the control file without unpacking
  the sources or applying patches.  Currently, it unpacks the sources,
  patches them, creates the control file, and a subsequent
  dpkg-buildpackage deletes the sources, re-unpacks them, and
  re-patches them.

- Reorganise debian/rules.defs to decide which packages to build in a
  more straightforward and less error-prone fashion: (1) start with
  all languages; override the list of languages depending on the name
  of the source package (gcc-4.2, gnat-4.2, gdc-4.2, gcj-4.2).  (2)
  filter the list of languages depending on the target platform; (3)
  depending on the languages to build, decide on which libraries to
  build.

o [Ludovic Brenta] Ada

- Done: Link the gnat tools with libgnat.so, instead of statically.

- Done: Build libgnatvsn containing parts of the compiler (version
  string, etc.) under GNAT-Modified GPL.  Link the gnat tools with it.

- Done: Build libgnatprj containing parts of the compiler (the project
  manager) under pure GPL.  Link the gnat tools with it.

- Done: Build both the zero-cost and setjump/longjump exceptions
  versions of libgnat.  In particular, gnat-glade (distributed systems)
  works best with SJLJ.

- Add support for building cross-compilers.

- Add support for multilib (not yet supported upstream).

* Fortran

- gfortran man page generation
