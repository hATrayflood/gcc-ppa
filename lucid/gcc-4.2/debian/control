Package: treelang-4.2
Architecture: any
Priority: optional
Depends: gcc-4.2-base (= ${gcc:Version}), gcc-4.2 (= ${gcc:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: The GNU Treelang compiler
 Treelang is a sample language, useful only to help people understand how
 to implement a new language front end to GCC. It is not a useful
 language in itself other than as an example or basis for building a new
 language. Therefore only language developers are likely to have an
 interest in it.

Replaces: gcc-soft-float-ss
Description: The soft-floating-point gcc libraries (arm)
 These are versions of basic static libraries such as libgcc.a compiled
 with the -msoft-float option, for CPUs without a floating-point unit.

Package: fixincludes
Architecture: any
Priority: optional
Depends: gcc-4.2-base (= ${gcc:Version}), gcc-4.2 (= ${gcc:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Fix non-ANSI header files
 FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many
 system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ANSI compliant.
 The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
 FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.
 .
 Not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
 package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
 packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.
