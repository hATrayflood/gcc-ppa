		The Debian GNU Compiler Collection setup
		========================================

Please see the README.Debian in /usr/share/doc/gcc, contained in the
gcc package for a description of the setup of the different compiler
versions.


Notes on GCC 3.4 in the sarge distribution
------------------------------------------

[package maintainers: when using GCC 3.4 for package building, please
 check that your packages still work on platforms with GCC changes
 specific for these platforms (hppa, m68k, mips, mipsel, sparc).       ]

GCC 3.4 is included in sarge as a newer compiler version, the system
compiler for sarge is GCC 3.3 (the transition to a newer system compiler
is a post sarge issue).  Due to some incompatibilities between
3.3 and 3.4 care should be taken, when some code built by both versions
is linked together (most likely linking against a shared library found
in Debian):

- C++ code compiled by g++-3.3 and g++-3.4 is not compatible.  Applications
  using C++ libraries have to make sure that these libraries are rebuilt.

- On i386, the compiler is built as a biarch compiler (can generated code
  for amd64). To use it, call gcc-3.4 -m64. Packages containing the 64bit
  versions of libraries and library development files need to be installed
  separately (i.e. lib64gcc1, amd64-libs, ...).
  gcc-3.4 -m64 turns on the common subset for all x86-64 architectures,
  specifying -march=k8 turns on k8/opteron specific features, -march=nocona
  turns on some P4/64 Nocona specific features.

- On hppa and m68k the exception handling changed from SJLJ to Dwarf2 based
  exception handling. This affects C++ and code, which implements it's own
  handling. If a library or binary ends up linked against libgcc1 _and_
  libgcc2, something probably won't work.

- The implementation of the MIPS ABIs has changed. As a result, the code
  generated for certain MIPS targets will not be binary compatible with
  earlier releases. See http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/mips-abi.html

- The implementation of the SPARC ABIs has changed. As a result, the code
  generated will not be binary compatible with earlier releases in certain
  cases. See http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/sparc-abi.html
