Files in this directory are used to cross-compile libunwind while building
cross-gcc for ia64 target. Libunwind source can't cross-compile as-is because
it builds tools to generate two header files that are used later in build
process, and this procedure can't handle cross-compiling case properly.

Fixing build procedure seems too hard because autotools don't seem to
support this case.

So, as a temporary solution, files are pre-built on ia64 host and provided
in this directory.
